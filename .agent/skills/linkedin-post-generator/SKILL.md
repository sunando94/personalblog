# LinkedIn Post Generation Strategy

Follow these rules to maximize reach and engagement while maintaining a strictly human expert voice:

## 1. Tone and Style (Human-Centric)
- **Human Expert Voice**: The post must sound like an engineer sharing a lesson, not an AI summarizing a document.
- **Conversational & Relatable**: Use first-person ("I", "my"). Use analogies and real-world examples to explain complex topics.
- **Sentence Variety**: Mix short, punchy sentences with longer, descriptive ones to create a natural reading rhythm.
- **Avoid "AI-isms"**: Do not use clichés like "In the rapidly evolving landscape," "Delve into," or "It's important to note."
- **NO EMOJIS**: Do not use emojis anywhere. They often signal AI-presence and can detract from technical credibility.
- **NO ITALICS**: Do not use `*italics*` or `_italics_` for emphasis. Use sparse bolding only if absolutely necessary, or let the writing provide the emphasis.

## 2. Content Structure
- **The Hook (Cracking the "See More" Barrier)**:
  - Start with a provocative question or a personal observation in the first 2 lines. 
  - Aim for curiosity without being clickbaity (e.g., "I spent the last week debugging why our RAG system was giving us answers about car repairs when we asked about legal docs.").
- **Core Value (Native Content)**:
  - Provide a distilled version of the key insights directly in the post.
  - Use short paragraphs and numbered lists for readability.
- **Visuals**:
  - Recommend adding a screenshot of a diagram, a code snippet, or a relevant technical graphic.
- **The "Link in Comments" Strategy**:
  - **NEVER** include the external link in the main post. It throttles reach.
  - End with a low-key transition: "I wrote a more detailed breakdown for those who want to see the code and diagrams. Link is in the first comment below."

## 3. Posting Logistics
- **Optimal Times**: Suggest Tuesday mornings (before 10 AM) or Thursday evenings (after 5 PM).
- **Golden Hour**: Remind the user to respond to comments within the first 60 minutes to boost the algorithm's "Golden Hour" test.

## 4. Length
- Aim for **150-300 words** (~8+ lines) to ensure the "See More" button appears and readers stay on the post (increasing dwell time).
